# Dominion Beeper

## How to contribute
* Have node and npm
* `npm install`
* `npm run start` to start webpack in development mode (webpack will watch for changes and recompile as needed)
* The "finished product" (a bundle with code and a `manifest.json` that can be loaded into chrome as an extension) will be in the directory `extension`.
